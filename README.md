pygramm
=======

This is the set of modules to create and maintain different types of tokenizers, lexers and parsers. The idea is to create a chain of processing in python that can generate the output for any programming language. 

I'm planning to put here some very early stage code, so don't be surprised that it may not work or crash. Whenever I'll enter a stable phase of the project I'll write about it here.
